at UFRGS, Brazil Lectured by Dr. Marcelo Soares Pimenta

Final project of the course was to develop a Android Mimic APP. A prototype was developed where words separated by category appear on the screen for 30 seconds, and change when the user trying to guess performe an action of "right guess" or "pass" 

To manage the word database we used sqlite. And developed everyting on Android Studio. Invision to project the layout of the app. Trello was used to organize the project, and Agile Methods paradigms were used during the development stage. One main functionality lacking is the automatic photo capturing without preview every 5 seconds, the goal was to take pictures of people doing the mimic.
